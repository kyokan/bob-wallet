# Bob Wallet: A Handshake Wallet and Full Node

Bob Wallet is a [Handshake](https://handshake.org) wallet with an integrated full node.

**Status**: This is beta software. As with all wallet GUIs, please use with care, and at your own risk.

## How to Install Bob Wallet

Most users should use the prebuilt binaries in this repo's [releases](https://github.com/kyokan/bob-wallet/releases) page.

Note: this screenshot is unlikely to age well but the filetypes are highlighted so you know what to install. It says 0.2.6 here but you should always look for the [latest](https://github.com/kyokan/bob-wallet/releases/latest) version.

* OSX: .dmg
* Windows: .msi
* Linux: .AppImage

### macOS

For macOS users, Bob is also available through the [Homebrew](https://github.com/homebrew/brew) package manager:

#### Install

```bash
brew install kyokan-bob
```

> **Note**: If a new version of Bob was recently released, try running `brew livecheck kyokan-bob` to check if Homebrew is aware of it yet. If the command indicates that its version is older than the latest release, you can automatically open a PR to update the cask for everyone with the following command:
> `brew bump-cask-pr --version <VERSION> kyokan-bob`

#### Uninstall
By default, uninstalling with Brew *does not* remove any of the chain or wallet data sync'd by the built-in HSD node:

```bash
brew uninstall kyokan-bob
```

#### Hard Uninstall
However, if you do want to completely uninstall Bob *and* delete all stored data, use the `--zap` flag:

```bash
brew uninstall --zap kyokan-bob
```

> Always ***backup your private keys*** before running this command!

If you reinstall Bob again after `--zap`ing it, your keys/wallets will need to be re-imported, re-scanned, and, if running as local full node, Bob will also need to resync the entire blockchain again. A "fresh" reinstall like this may sometimes be necessary when upgrading from certain versions of Bob _(see version-specific release notes for details)_.

## Features

Bob supports all of the following features:

1. Name auctions
2. DNS record management
3. Send/receive coins

## Contributing

Contributions are most welcome.  Some contributor activity occurs on [Telegram/bobwallet](https://t.me/bobwallet).

Inquiries to integrate with hardware wallets, ecosystem DNS/website infrastructure, and offers to collaborate with other Handshake-aligned projects are also most welcome. Please make inquiries via Telegram, to `[at]sdtsui`.

If you are an individual developer looking to add a feature, fix a bug, or create new documentation -- please feel free to reach out, even if just to say hello.  We are also exploring incentivization mechanisms, potentially ramping up from small bounties to ecosystem-funded full-time developers.

### Building From Source

Please see this [guide](https://gist.github.com/pinheadmz/314aed5123d29cb89bfc6a7db9f4d02e), courtesy of [@pinheadmz](https://github.com/pinheadmz).  It explains how to get set up in dev mode, and includes some helpful tips like (i) how to tail log output and (ii) how one can have a "personal mainnet" Bob while developing on a different Bob instance.

Due to Ledger USB integration, additional dependencies are required:

#### OSX

If you are running OSX on an arm64 processor (aka "Apple Silicon" or "M1") it
is highly recommended to upgrade to Node.js v16
[which has arm64 support.](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.0.0/#toolchain-and-compiler-upgrades)

Building for OSX requires one extra "optional" dependency (dmg-license)
[that can not currently be installed on Windows/Linux systems](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/6520):

```bash
brew install libusb
git clone https://github.com/kyokan/bob-wallet
cd bob-wallet
npm install
npm install dmg-license
```

Build the app package *for the native architecture of your Mac*:

```bash
npm run package-mac
```

If you are running OSX on an arm64 but want to build the executable for x86 (Intel)
Macs, you can do so but you must first downgrade to Node.js v14 or re-install Node.js v16
for x86 instead of arm64. Building for a non-native architecture will seriously impair
the performance of the application, so this option is only recommended for multi-platform
distribution by maintainers with M1 Macs. As an extra complication, this process must
be run in an environment where `libunbound` is available as an x86 package.

```bash
npm run package-mac-intel
``` 

The output app will be created in the `/release/mac` or `/release/mac-arm64` folder.
Open `Bob.app` to start the wallet.


#### Linux

```bash
apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
git clone https://github.com/kyokan/bob-wallet
cd bob-wallet
npm install
```

Build the app package:

```bash
npm run package-linux
```

The output app will be created in the `/release` folder. Open `Bob-x.x.x.AppImage` to start the wallet.

##### Ledger

Note that to use Ledger devices with Linux, permissions must be granted to access the USB device.
Follow Ledger's own guide [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues)
which will instruct you to execute this command:

```
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/add_udev_rules.sh | sudo bash
```


#### Test in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```
