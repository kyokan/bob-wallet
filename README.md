# Bob Wallet: A Handshake Wallet and Full Node

Bob Wallet is a [Handshake](https://handshake.org) wallet with an integrated full node.

**Status**: This is beta software. As with all wallet GUIs, please use with care, and at your own risk.

## How to Install Bob Wallet

Most users should use the prebuilt binaries in this repo's [releases](https://github.com/kyokan/bob-wallet/releases) page.

![GitHub releases page screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8230144/75097836-06f48480-5564-11ea-85db-64251184e7bf.png)

Note: this screenshot is unlikely to age well but the filetypes are highlighted so you know what to install. It says 0.2.6 here but you should always look for the [latest](https://github.com/kyokan/bob-wallet/releases/latest) version.

* **OSX:** `.dmg` (x86 = Intel; arm64 = Apple Silicon)
* **Windows:** `.msi`
* **Linux:** `.AppImage`

For macOS users, Bob is also available through the [Homebrew](https://github.com/homebrew/brew) package manager:

```bash
brew install kyokan-bob
```

### Verify downloaded binaries

1. Download a _SHA256SUMS.asc_ file included into the release
2. Paste the file's content into https://keybase.io/verify and click "Verify"
3. Make sure the file's signer is a trusted signer mentioned in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#trusted-pgp-keys)
4. Compare a checksum of a downloaded Bob Wallet app file:
```
# Linux
sha256sum Bob-2.1.1.AppImage

# Windows
certUtil -hashfile Bob-2.1.1.msi SHA256

# macOS
shasum -a 256 Bob-2.1.1-x86.dmg
shasum -a 256 Bob-2.1.1-arm64.dmg
```

For more details and more advanced PGP signature verification see https://github.com/kyokan/bob-wallet/pull/612.

## Uninstall

Bob Wallet can be uninstalled from your OS apps list. This _does not_ delete any blockchain and wallet data.

To completely remove all stored data, delete the `Bob` directory which can be found in _Settings -> General_. If Bob was installed with brew, then `brew uninstall --zap kyokan-bob` will do this for you.

>Since this deletes wallet data, be sure to **backup your seed phrases** first.

## Features

Bob supports all of the following features:

1. Name auctions
2. DNS record management
3. Send/receive coins

Contributions are most welcome.  Some contributor activity occurs on [Telegram/bobwallet](https://t.me/bobwallet).

Inquiries to integrate with hardware wallets, ecosystem DNS/website infrastructure, and offers to collaborate with other Handshake-aligned projects are also most welcome. Please make inquiries via Telegram, to `[at]sdtsui`.

If you are an individual developer looking to add a feature, fix a bug, or create new documentation -- please feel free to reach out, even if just to say hello.  We are also exploring incentivization mechanisms, potentially ramping up from small bounties to ecosystem-funded full-time developers.

### Building From Source

Please see this [guide](https://gist.github.com/pinheadmz/314aed5123d29cb89bfc6a7db9f4d02e), courtesy of [@pinheadmz](https://github.com/pinheadmz).  It explains how to get set up in dev mode, and includes some helpful tips like (i) how to tail log output and (ii) how one can have a "personal mainnet" Bob while developing on a different Bob instance.

Due to Ledger USB integration, additional dependencies are required:

#### OSX

If you are running OSX on an arm64 processor (aka "Apple Silicon" or "M1") it
is highly recommended to upgrade to Node.js v16
[which has arm64 support.](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.0.0/#toolchain-and-compiler-upgrades)

Building for OSX requires one extra "optional" dependency (dmg-license)
[that can not currently be installed on Windows/Linux systems](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/6520):

```bash
brew install libusb
git clone https://github.com/kyokan/bob-wallet
cd bob-wallet
npm install
npm install dmg-license
```

Build the app package *for the native architecture of your Mac*:

```bash
npm run package-mac
```

If you are running OSX on an arm64 but want to build the executable for x86 (Intel)
Macs, you can do so but you must first downgrade to Node.js v14 or re-install Node.js v16
for x86 instead of arm64. Building for a non-native architecture will seriously impair
the performance of the application, so this option is only recommended for multi-platform
distribution by maintainers with M1 Macs. As an extra complication, this process must
be run in an environment where `libunbound` is available as an x86 package.

```bash
npm run package-mac-intel
```

The output app will be created in the `/release/mac` or `/release/mac-arm64` folder.
Open `Bob.app` to start the wallet.


#### Linux

```bash
apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
git clone https://github.com/kyokan/bob-wallet
cd bob-wallet
npm install
```

Build the app package:

```bash
npm run package-linux
```

The output app will be created in the `/release` folder. Open `Bob-x.x.x.AppImage` to start the wallet.

##### Ledger

Note that to use Ledger devices with Linux, permissions must be granted to access the USB device.
Follow Ledger's own guide [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues)
which will instruct you to execute this command:

```
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/add_udev_rules.sh | sudo bash
```


#### Test in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```
