Specifically, Handshake Network participants can purchase TLDs by participating in auctions that allow such participants to bid on TLDs as part of a Vickrey auction. The owner of a Handshake TLD can use its TLD in a variety of ways, including but not limited to offering subdomain services, hosting censorship-resistant websites, or reselling TLDs to other interested parties. In addition, certain users may be eligible to claim HNS that was allocated to them in a randomized process by the creators of the Handshake Network.

Such private key may be in the form of a mnemonic seed phrase. Regardless, the private and public key pair together evidence ownership/possession of a specific amount of HNS in that Wallet which enables you to send and receive HNS via the Handshake Network. The public key is visible to all participants of the Handshake Network. The private key must be used to transact the HNS represented by the corresponding public key. You will also create a password to access your Wallet and your private key as a security or convenience measure. In this instance, your password method may function similarly to your private key in that it allows you and others in possession of such information to potentially transfer HNS from your Wallet if they have access to your Wallet.
